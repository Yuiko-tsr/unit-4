* A profile page with relevant information

# Criteria C
## Tools used
* HTTP server
* POST, GET Request
* SQLite databases 
* Functions
* For loops
* If statements
* Variables
* Encryption
* Nesting loops
* Cookie
* CSS designs

## Sources
1. For login systems I used a template: https://colorlib.com/wp/html5-and-css3-login-forms/ 
2. For button designes I used template: https://www.cirrus-ui.com/buttons/button-groups

# Criteria E
# Evaluation of the product
In order to improve the usability, I made sure the design was consistent with intentional color coordinations and font consistency.
Moreover, the tables used in the home page where users can navigate to view all the movies/foods or when viewing all the movies/foods allows users to understand the page clearly and allows organization of the page.

Furthermore, the simplicity of the design allows users of any age or technology familiarity to navigate through the system easily.

# Recommendations for further improvement
Below are some other functions that could be added for improvement
* Posting images
* Sending Emails
* Forgot Password/Change Password functions
* Adding categories
* Viewing liked posts/topics
